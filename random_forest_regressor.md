# Random Forest Regressor

A Random Forest Regressor is a regression algorithm that uses multiple decision trees and a technique called Bootstrap Aggregation to predict the dependent variable. Bootstrap Aggregation, commonly known as bagging, in the Random Forest method, involves training each decision tree on a different data sample where sampling is done with replacement. The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on individual decision trees.
