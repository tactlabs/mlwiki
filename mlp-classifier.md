# Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier(MLPClassifier)

The Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network. An MLP consists of multiple layers and each layer is fully connected to the following one. The nodes of the layers are neurons with nonlinear activation functions, except for the nodes of the input layer. Between the input and the output layer there may be one or more nonlinear hidden layers.
