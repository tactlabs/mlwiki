# Kernel Support Vector Machines

Kernel Support Vector Machines(KSVMs) is a classification algorithm that is used to maximize the margin between the classes by mapping the input vectors to a higher dimensional plane. KSVMs use the hinge loss function to minimize the error and increase the performance.
