# Improving the performance

Enhancing a model performance can be challenging at times. A lot of you would agree with me if you’ve found yourself stuck in a similar situation. You try all the strategies and algorithms that you’ve learned. Yet, you fail at improving the accuracy of your model. And, this is where 90% of the data scientists give up.

Here are the 8 most efficient way to improve a Machine learning model's perfomance :

* Add more data :
      Having more data is always a good idea. It allows the “data to tell for itself,” instead of relying on assumptions and weak correlations. Presence of more data results in better and accurate models

* Treat missing and Outlier values :
      The unwanted presence of missing and outlier values in the training data often reduces the accuracy of a model or leads to a biased model. It leads to inaccurate predictions. This is because we don’t analyse the behavior and relationship with other variables correctly. So, it is important to treat missing and outlier values well.

* Feature Engineering :
      This step helps to extract more information from existing data. New information is extracted in terms of new features. These features may have a higher ability to explain the variance in the training data. Thus, giving improved model accuracy.

      Feature engineering is highly influenced by hypotheses generation. Good hypothesis result in good features.

* Feature Selection :
      Feature Selection is a process of finding out the best subset of attributes which better explains the relationship of independent variables with target variable. 

* Multiple algorithms :
      Hitting at the right machine learning algorithm is the ideal approach to achieve higher accuracy. But, it is easier said than done.

      This intuition comes with experience and incessant practice. Some algorithms are better suited to a particular type of data sets than others. Hence, we should apply all relevant models and check the performance.

* Algorithm Tuning :
      The objective of parameter tuning is to find the optimum value for each parameter to improve the accuracy of the model. To tune these parameters, you must have a good understanding of these meaning and their individual impact on model. You can repeat this process with a number of well performing models.

* Ensemble methods :
      This is the most common approach found majorly in winning solutions of Data science competitions. This technique simply combines the result of multiple weak models and produce better results. This can be achieved through many ways:

               * Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
               * Boosting

* Cross Validation :
       To find the right answer of any question, we must use cross validation technique. Cross Validation is one of the most important concepts in data modeling.
