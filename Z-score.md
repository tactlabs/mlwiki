# Z-Score

A Z-score is a numerical value that describes a value's connection to the mean of a group of values. 

Z-score is measured by getting the standard deviations from the mean. 

If a Z-score is 0, 
 - It reveals that the data point's score is similar to the mean score.

A Z-score of 1.0 
 - Thiswould show a value that is one standard deviation from the mean.
 
Z-scores may be positive or negative
 - Positive value indicating the score is above the mean 
 - Negative score indicating it is below the mean.
