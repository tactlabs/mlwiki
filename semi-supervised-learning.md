# Semi-Supervised learning

Semi-Supervised learning is where you use a training dataset with both labeled and unlabeled data. It’s particularly useful when it’s difficult to extract relevant features from data — and when you have a high volume of data.

Semi-supervised learning is ideal for medical images, where a small amount of training data can lead to a significant improvement in accuracy. For example, a radiologist can label a small subset of CT scans for tumors or diseases so the machine can more accurately predict which patients might require more medical attention.
