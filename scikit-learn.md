# Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is a python library for machine learning. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction. It is mainly used for training and using Machine Learning models out of the box. It allows developers to not have to build the models from scratch, but rather, take a model that is already built and use it without a worry. It also comes with some pre-defined data sets that you can use out of the box to start learning and solving your first machine learning problems, trying out new techniques, etc
