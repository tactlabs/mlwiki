# Outlier

An outlier is a data point which has a huge deviation from the rest of the data. Outliers are introduced in a data due to natural anomaly or incorrect entry. There are 3 types of outliers:

- Global Outliers: data point is far outside the dataset in which it is found. For example, a student with a height of 200 cm is an outlier to a class with an average height of 160 cm.

- Contextual Outlier: data point is deviated compared to other data in the same context. For example, a cool day in summer season.

- Collective Outlier: subset of data deviates significantly from the entire dataset, but the individual data points are not outliers in a global or contextual sense. In a class, a student being absent is not an outlier, but if a significant number of students are absent on the same day, it is an outlier.
