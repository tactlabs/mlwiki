# Learning Vector Quantization(LVQ) Neural Networks

Learning Vector Quantization(LVQ) Neural Networks are used to comprehensibly visualize extremely large datasets. It does so by dimensionally reducing the dataset by forming multiple clusters. It is very similar to Kohonen's Neural Network with the only difference being that in LVQ Neural Networks, a random weight matrix is taken at first which is being updated constantly.
