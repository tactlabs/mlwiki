# MAE

Mean absolute error (or mean absolute deviation) is a metric which finds the average absolute distance between the predicted and target values.

MAE is known to be more robust to the outliers than MSE. The main reason being that in MSE by squaring the errors, the outliers (which usually have higher errors than other samples) get more attention and dominance in the final error and impacting the model parameters.
