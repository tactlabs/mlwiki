# Activation Function

<br>

An activation function is a non-linear transformation done on the input before sending it the next layer of neurons or finalizing as output. It is used in artificial neural networks to decide if a neuron "fires" or not. They add non-linearity to neural networks thus allowing them to perform powerful tasks such as image recognition. Rectified linear unit(ReLU) and the family of sigmoid functions such as logistic sigmoid function, hyperbolic tangent and the arctangent functions are some well known activation functions.
