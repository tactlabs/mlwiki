# Entropy

Entropy is a parameter used Decision Tree algorithms to improve the accuracy. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty of the output based on a feature. The aim of a decision tree is to minimize the value of entropy to make more accurate predictions. Entropy takes a value between 0 and 1, with values closer to 0 correlating to higher degrees of certainty.
