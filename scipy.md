# SciPy

SciPy stands for Scientific Python. SciPy is open source. SciPy has optimized and added functions that are frequently used in NumPy and Data Science. SciPy is predominantly written in Python, but a few segments are written in C. SciPy extends NumPy providing additional tools for array computing and provides specialized data structures, such as sparse matrices and k-dimensional trees.
