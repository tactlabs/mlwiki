# Data Augmentation

Data Augmentation is a set of techniques to increase the amount of training data by generating new data points using existing data. This includes making small changes to data or using deep learning models to generate new data points.

Adding more data helps to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning models by creating new and unique data from the training data set. If the data used to train the machine learning model is rich and sufficient, the model works better and more accurately.

Advantages:

- Improve model's accuracy
- adding additional training data to models
- preventing data shortages
- reducing data overfitting
- to help solve the problems of class imbalance in classification
