# Perceptron

Perceptron is the first and simplest form of neural network, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in the year 1957. It consists of one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. It took a number of binary inputs, and produced a binary output. Furthermore, it used different weights to represent the importance of each input and the sum of the weighted input was called the weighted sum. Based on whether the weighted sum was greater than a threshold value or not, an output was produced.

Limitations:

- Can work only on binary inputs
- can produce only binary output
- can only classify linearly separable input
