# Bagging

Bagging, also known as Bootstrap aggregation, is an ensemble learning method used to deal with bias-variance trade-offs and reduce the variance of a model. It is used to avoid overfitting of data and is used for both regression and classification models, specially for decision tree algorithms.

Disadvantages:

- Loss of interpretability: difficult to draw insights due to the averaging involved across predictions.
- Computationally expensive: slows down and grows more memory intensive as number of iterations increases. Thus, it is not suited for real-time application.
- Less flexible: works well with less stable algorithms. Does't provide as much benefit for algorithms which are more stable.
