# Baseline Model

A baseline model is a very simple model that is created in a short amount of time. It has to be created using the same data and outcome variable that will be used to create your actual model. This simple model will act as a baseline for the actual complex model that is to be built.

Advantages:

- Understand data faster: can identify which classes are difficult to identify
- Benchmark for actual model: used as a benchmark to understand the performance of the actual model
- Increases productivity: can be used as a foundation to build the actual model faster.
