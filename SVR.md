# Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a regression algorithm that uses the same principle as Support Vector Machine(SVM).The main idea behind SVR is to fit the error inside a certain threshold which means, work of SVR is to approximate the best value within a given margin called Îµ- tube. SVR is robust to the outliers.
