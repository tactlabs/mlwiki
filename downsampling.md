# Downsampling

In machine learning, downsampling can mean either of the two things:

- Reduce the amount of information in a feature to train the model effectively. For example, before training an image recognition model, downsampling high-resolution images into a low-resolution format.

- Training with a lower percentage of data of highly represented classes in order to improve model training in less represented classes. For example, in a class imbalanced dataset, models tend to learn a lot about the majority class and not enough about the minority class. Downsampling helps to balance the amount of training across all classes.
