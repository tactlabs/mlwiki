# Clustering

The word “cluster” refers to collection or grouping of entities and datas. Likewise, Clustering is a Machine Learning Technique which groups the unlabelled data. Clustering is of two types namely
* Hard clustering 
* Soft clustering.

Hard Clustering : Hard clustering is about grouping the data items such that each item is only assigned to one cluster. In hard clustering, each data point either belongs to a cluster completely or not.

Soft Clustering: Soft clustering (also known as fuzzy clustering) is a form clustering where observations may belong to multiple clusters. For soft clustering algorithms, we need to compute a fuzziness coefficient that controls the degree of fuzziness.
