# Traditional signal processing


Signal processing algorithm analyses, modifies and synthesises sound signals, images, and scientific measurements. These are typically built on three basic functions: Add, Multiply, and Delay. The functions are combined to build up complex algorithms in discrete-time systems. Traditional signal processing techniques include filtering, detection, estimation and frequency domain analysis.
