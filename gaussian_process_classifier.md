# Gaussian Process Classifier

The Gaussian Processes Classifier is a classification machine learning algorithm.

Gaussian Processes are a generalization of the Gaussian probability distribution and can be used as the basis for sophisticated non-parametric machine learning algorithms for classification and regression.

They are a type of kernel model, like SVMs, and unlike SVMs, they are capable of predicting highly calibrated class membership probabilities, although the choice and configuration of the kernel used at the heart of the method can be challenging.

In probability theory and statistics, a Gaussian process is a stochastic process (a collection of random variables indexed by time or space), such that every finite collection of those random variables has a multivariate normal distribution, i.e. every finite linear combination of them is normally distributed.
Likewise, the Gaussian processes model is a probabilistic supervised machine learning framework that has been widely used for regression and classification tasks. A Gaussian processes regression (GPR) model can make predictions incorporating prior knowledge (kernels) and provide uncertainty measures.
