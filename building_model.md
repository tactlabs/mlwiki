# Building a Model

Building a model requires a lot of procedural parts and these steps are the key steps towards creating a model. Those first and primary steps would be to collect the data. The next step would be to prepare the data for visualisation. Right after this, the next step would be choosing the model and training the model and will be sent for further evaluation to check the accuracy ratio. If the accuracy ratio didn't produce the produced results, then the parameters of the model are recorrected accordingly and once it is done, the model is ready to be deployed.
