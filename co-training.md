# Co-training

Co-training is a machine learning algorithm used for classification problems when there is a large amount of unlabeled data compared to labeled data. This method requires the dataset to have two different sets of predictive features that are independent and complementary to each other. The algorithm first learns a separate classifier for each set using any labeled examples. The most confident predictions of each classifier on the unlabeled data are then used to iteratively construct additional labeled training data. It is extensively used for text mining for search engines.
