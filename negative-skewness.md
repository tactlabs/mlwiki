# Negative Skewness

If the given distribution is shifted to the right and with its tail on the left side, it is a negatively skewed distribution. 

It is also called a left-skewed distribution. The skewness value of any distribution showing a negative skew is always less than zero. 

The skewness of the given distribution is on the left; hence, the mean value is less than the median and moves towards the left, and the mode occurs at the highest frequency of the distribution.
