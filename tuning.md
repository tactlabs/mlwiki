# Hyperparameter Tuning

Tuning is the process of maximizing a model's performance without overfitting or creating too high of a variance. 


Selecting the best parameter for an algorithm is essential as it determines the learning process of the algorithm and its performance. 

With the help of hyperparameter tuning, we can choose the best parameter for an algorithm so that model can give a good prediction and perform well enough to solve a problem.

* Hyperparameter tuning is computationally expensive.
* Hyperparameter tuning is Time-consuming.

Hyperparameters control the behavior of the algorithm that is used for modeling. 

Each weight and bias in a neural network is a parameter. Hyperparameters, on the other hand, are specific to the algorithm itself, so we can’t calculate their values from the data. 

We use hyperparameters to calculate the model parameters. Different hyperparameter values produce different model parameter values for a given data set. 

Hyperparameters maximizes the model’s performance, minimizing a predefined loss function to produce better results with fewer errors.
