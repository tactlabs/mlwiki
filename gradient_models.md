# Graphical Model

The Graphical model is a subdivision of Machine Learning. It uses a graph to signify a domain problem. A graph states the conditional need structure between random variables. These are being used in many Machine Learning algorithms

The two most common forms of graphical model are 
* Directed graphical models 
* Undirected graphical models
            based on directed acylic graphs and undirected graphs, respectively.

A graphical model or probabilistic graphical model (PGM) or structured probabilistic model is a probabilistic model for which a graph expresses the conditional dependence structure between random variables. They are commonly used in probability theory, statistics—particularly Bayesian statistics—and machine learning.
