# Logistic Function

Logistic function is an activation function that maps the entire number line into a small range such as between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. It is used to convert a real value into a probability. A Logistic function is usually placed as the last layer of a machine learning model to convert the output into probability which is easy to interpret. Logistic regression works on the principle of logistic function.
