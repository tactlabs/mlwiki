# Bag-of-words model

A bag-of-words model is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling, such as with machine learning algorithms. A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It is called a “bag” of words, because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document.
