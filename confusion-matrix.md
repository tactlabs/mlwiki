# Confusion Matrix

Key concept in classification performance is confusion matrix (AKA error matrix), which is a tabular visualization of the model predictions versus the ground-truth labels. A confusion matrix presents the ways in which a classification model becomes confused while making predictions. A good matrix (model) will have large values across the diagonal and small values off the diagonal. Measuring a confusion matrix provides better insight in particulars of is our classification model is getting correct and what types of errors it is creating.

* This is a table of four separate combinations of predicted and actual values.
* The table compares predicted values in Positive and Negative and actual values as True and False.
* These four elements are the fundamental building block of designing a confusion matrix.
