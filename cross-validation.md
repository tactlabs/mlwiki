# Cross-validation

Cross-validation is a technique used to assess a machine learning model and test its performance. In this technique, a specific subset of the dataset is reserved on which the model is not trained. Later, the model is tested against this subset to evaluate it.

It protects the model from overfitting, especially if the amount of data is limited.
