# Underfitting

Underfitting occurs when our machine learning model is not able to capture the underlying trend of the data Underfitting is where the model cannot create a mapping between the input and the target variable. Underfitting becomes obvious when the model is too simple and cannot create a relationship between the input and the output.

It is detected when the training error is very high and the model is unable to learn from the training data. High bias and low variance are the most common indicators of underfitting.
