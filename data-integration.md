# Data Integration 

Data integration is the process of bringing data from disparate sources together to provide users with a unified view. The premise of data integration is to make data more freely available and easier to consume and process by systems and users.

Data integration is an initiative that large companies use to create a data warehouse that combines multiple data sources in a relational database. Data integration helps companies gather relevant data from multiple sources on a single platform that gives users a real-time view of their business performance.
