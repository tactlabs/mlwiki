# Statistics and Probability

Probability and statistics are two branches of mathematics concerning the collection, analysis, interpretation, and display of data in the context of random events. They are often studied together due to their interrelationship. Statistics is an area of applied mathematics that deals with understanding how data can be used to solve complex problems. Probability is the measure of how likely an event will occur. The probabilities of all outcomes always sums up to 1.
