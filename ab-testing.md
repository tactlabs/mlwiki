# A/B Testing

A/B testing is a randomized experimentation in which two or more versions of the same variable are shown to different segments of a testing group at the same time to find out which version has more impact. It is also known as bucket testing or split-run testing.

In A/B testing, A refers to the control or original variable and B refers to variation or modified version of original variable.

Advantages:

- Helps to solve user pain points
- Reduce bounce rate
- Reduces the risk of modifications

Disadvantages:

- Good only for specific design problems with measurable outcomes
- Cost and time expensive
