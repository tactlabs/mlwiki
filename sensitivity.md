# Sensitivity

Sensitivity is a measure of how well a machine learning model can detect positive instances. It is also known as the true positive rate (TPR) or recall. A model with high sensitivity will have few false negatives, which means that it is missing a few of the positive instances. The higher the true positive rate, the better the model is in identifying the positive cases in the correct manner.

```
Sensitivity = (True Positive)/(True Positive + False Negative)
