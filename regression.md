# Regression

Regression is the process of finding a model or function for distinguishing the data into continuous real values instead of using classes or discrete values. Regression models are used to predict a continuous value.

Regression shows a line or curve that passes through all the datapoints on target-predictor graph in such a way that the vertical distance between the datapoints and the regression line is minimum.
