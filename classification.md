# Classification

Classification is a process of categorizing a given set of data into classes, It can be performed on both structured or unstructured data. Classification algorithms used in machine learning utilize input training data for the purpose of predicting the likelihood or probability that the data that follows will fall into one of the predetermined categories. The aim of classification is to determine which category an observation belongs to, and this is done by understanding the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables
The classification process deal with the problems where the data can be divided into binary or multiple discrete labels.

Classification is predicting that the data falls into either of the category which we have predefined.These categories are also known as classes.There are many types of classification model.

Naive bayes- It is used when the data which is classified is independent of each other.It uses bayes theorem in its model.

Decision trees - It's output is a tree like structure which answers a consequence of questions to get classified into a category.

K-Nearest Neighbours- It is classification based on the neighbouring ones.The predominant class which surrounds the point we are about to classify is assigned that class.
