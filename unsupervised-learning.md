# Unsupervised Learning

In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled and its goal is to find out the natural patterns present within data points in the given dataset. It does not have a feedback mechanism unlike supervised learning and hence this technique is known as unsupervised learning.

Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks, clustering, association and dimensionality reduction.
