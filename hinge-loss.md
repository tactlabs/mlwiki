# Hinge Loss

Hinge Loss is a loss function used to train classifiers. The hinge loss is designed to find the decision boundary as far as possible from each data point. As a result, the margin between data points and the boundary is maximum. Kernel Support Vector Machines use hinge loss extensively for maximum margin classification.
