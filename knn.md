# KNN

The abbreviation KNN stands for “K-Nearest Neighbour”. It is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The algorithm can be used to solve both classification and regression problem statements.

The number of nearest neighbours to a new unknown variable that has to be predicted or classified is denoted by the symbol ‘K’. 

Uses cases :
* Handwriting detection 
* Image recognition
* Video recognition.

KNN is most useful when labeled data is too expensive or impossible to obtain, and it can achieve high accuracy in a wide variety of prediction-type problems.
