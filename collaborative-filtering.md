# Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering filters information by using the interactions and data collected from other users. It's based on the idea that people who agreed in their evaluation of certain items are likely to agree again in the future. A number of users are selected based on their similarity to the active user. Inference for the active user is made by calculating a weighted average of the ratings of the selected users.
