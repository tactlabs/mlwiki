# Specificity

Specificity is proportion of actual negative values. Specificity measures the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified by the model.Â This proportion could also be called a **True Negative Rate (TNR)**.High specificity means that the model is correctly identifying most of the negative results, while a low specificity means that the model is mislabeling a lot of negative results as positive.

```
Specificity = (True Negative)/(True Negative + False Positive)
