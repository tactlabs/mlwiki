# Association Analysis

In Data science, the word “Association” refers to any relationship between any pair of variables. It comes under Unsupervised Machine learning where it finds the relationship between any pair of variables and maps with one another in such a way it brings out more productive results. Many algorithms are being used and the most efficient one is the Apriori algorithm.


Association models allow you to predict which items are most likely to appear together, and predict the strength of the relationship between them.

Testing Association :
 
Depending on the context, you could be using a diagram (like a scatter plot) to show an association between variables or using a hypothesis test to demonstrate statistically that relationships exist between variables. A bivariate association test involves one independent variable and one dependent variable.
