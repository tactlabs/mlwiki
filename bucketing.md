Bucketing means transforming numeric features to categorical features where we divide the numeric values either based into equally spaced boundaries or quantile boundaries.

Equally spaced boundaries means the gap between the 2 boundaries will be equal whereas in quantile boundaries the number of lines between the boundaries is equal.
