# ML-flow

It is an open source platform where you can deploy machine learning models and it is logged along with its output which will be useful for further reference.

It has the following primary components:

Tracking: Allows you to track experiments to record and compare parameters and results.

Models: Allow you to manage and deploy models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platforms.

Projects: Allow you to package ML code in a reusable, reproducible form to share with other data scientists or transfer to production.

Model Registry: Allows you to centralize a model store for managing modelsâ€™ full lifecycle stage transitions: from staging to production, with capabilities for versioning and annotating.

Model Serving: Allows you to host MLflow Models as REST endpoints.

MLflow supports Java, Python, R, and REST APIs.
