# Overfitting 

Overfitting is in which a model tries to fit the training data entirely and ends up memorizing the data patterns and the noise/random fluctuations. These models fail to generalize and perform well in the case of unseen data scenarios, defeating the model's purpose.

For overfitting, Training error will be small and Modelâ€™s accuracy will be high. Test error will be high.
