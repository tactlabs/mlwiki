# RMSprop Optimizer

RMSprop is an extension of Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm with rectifies the vanishing gradient and exploding gradient problems. RMSprop deals with the above issue by using a moving average of squared gradients to normalize the gradient. This normalization balances the value of the step, decreasing the step for large gradients to avoid exploding and increasing the step for small gradients to avoid vanishing.
