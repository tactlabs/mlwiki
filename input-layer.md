# Input Layer

In deep learning, the input layer is the most fundamental of all layers as all neural networks should have an input layer. Depending on the type of input, the input layer may be an 2D image, 3D image, Sequence data input, etc. An input layer can also perform certain functions which optimizes the neural network like normalization.
