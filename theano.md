# Theano

Theano is a python library used to evaluate mathematical operations efficiently. It is commonly used in neural network models as it allows to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions, including multi-dimensional arrays. It can attain high speed calculations that can even rival C implementations for various problems involving large amount of data. It works better on a GPU than on a CPU.

Features:

- arithmetic simplification
- memory aliasing to avoid calculation
- constant folding
- merge similar subgraphs to avoid redundant calculation
- loop fusion for element-wise sub-expressions
- GPU computation

Advantages:

- Stability optimization
- High execution speed
- Symbolic differentiation
