# Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis(PCA) is a statistical method used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still has most of the information from the large set.

Reducing the number of variables in a data set results in decrease in accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Smaller data sets are easier to understand and visualize and make analyzing data much easier and faster.
