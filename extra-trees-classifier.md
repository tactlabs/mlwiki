# Extra Trees Classifier

Extra Trees Classifier is an ensemble learning method, based on decision trees, which randomizes certain decisions and subsets of data to minimize over-learning from the data and overfitting. Extra Trees, like Random Forest, builds multiple trees and splits nodes using random subsets of features, but with two major differences: it samples without replacement, and nodes are split on random splits, not best splits
