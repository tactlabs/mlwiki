# Machine Translation

Machine translation, is a sub-field of computational linguistics that investigates the use of software to translate text or speech from one language to another. On a basic level, machine translation performs mechanical substitution of words in one language for words in another. On a complex level, corpus statistical and neural techniques are used for better translations, handling differences in linguistic typology, translation of idioms, and the isolation of anomalies.
