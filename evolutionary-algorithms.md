# Evolutionary algorithms


As a subset of evolutionary computation, evolutionary algorithms are generic population-based metaheuristic optimisation algorithms. They provide a heuristic-based approach to solving problems that cannot be easily solved in polynomial time. The approaches used are inspired by biological evolution and occur in four processes: initialisation, selection, genetic operators, and termination.
