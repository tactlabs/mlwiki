# Pixel RNN

Pixel Recurrent Neural Networks are generative models that are a subset of unsupervised learning. In Pixel RNN, new data is generated from the same explicit distribution governed by a probability distribution.

Advantages

- Provides a way to calculate likelihood
- The training is more stable than GANs
- It works for both discrete and continuous data
