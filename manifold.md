# Manifold learning

An approach to non-linear dimensionality reduction, manifold learning algorithms believe that the dimensionality of data sets is only artificially high. The algorithm generalises linear frameworks to be sensitive to non-linear structures in the data. This is usually unsupervised since it learns the structure from the data itself.
