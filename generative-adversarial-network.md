# Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)

Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) are used for generative modeling, using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks. Generative modeling involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate new examples that could have been drawn from the original dataset.

GANs trains a generative model by considering the problem as a supervised learning problem with two sub-models - the generator model and the discriminator model. The generator model is trained to generate new examples. The discriminator classifies the examples as either real(from the domain) or fake(generated). The two models are trained together until the discriminator model is fooled about half the time, meaning the generator model is generating plausible examples.
