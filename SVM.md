# Support vector machines

Support vector machines are algorithms that can be used to perform both classification and regression. The objective of the support vector machine algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space(N = the number of features) that distinctly classifies the data points. Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that help classify the data points. Data points falling on either side of the hyperplane can be attributed to different classes. The hyperplane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes is chosen.
