# Iterative Dichotomiser 3(ID3)

Iterative Dichotomiser 3(ID3) is an algorithm used for the construction of decision trees. This algorithm repeatedly divides the features into subgroups by using a top-down greedy approach. It uses Information Gain and Entropy as parameters to determine the best feature to split on.

Disadvantages

- May have selection bias towards features with greater number of distinct values.
- Can only be used for classification trees and not for regression trees.
