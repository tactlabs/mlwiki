# Data Mining

Data mining is the process of finding anomalies, patterns and correlations within large data sets to predict outcomes. Using a broad range of techniques, you can use this information to increase revenues, cut costs, improve customer relationships, reduce risks and more.

In today's modern world, we are all surrounded by big data, which is predicted to be grown by 40% by the next decade. You may wonder that the real fact is that we are drowning in the data, but at the same time, we are starving for knowledge (or useful Data). The main reason behind this, all this data creates noise which makes it difficult to mine. In short, we have generated tons of amorphous data but experiencing failing big data initiatives as the useful data is deeply buried inside. Therefore without powerful tools such as Data Mining, we cannot mine such data, and as a result, we will not get any benefits from that data.

It has the capability of transforming raw data into information that can help businesses grow by taking better decisions. Data mining has several types, including pictorial data mining, text mining, social media mining, web mining, and audio and video mining amongst others. Read: Data Mining vs Machine Learning.

Types of Data Mining :
* Predictive Data Mining Analysis :
      As the name signifies, Predictive Data-Mining analysis works on the data that may help to know what may happen later (or in the future) in business. Predictive Data-Mining can also be further divided into four types that are listed below:

             * Classification Analysis
             * Regression Analysis
             * Time Serious Analysis
             * Prediction Analysis
             
* Descriptive Data Mining Analysis :
      The main goal of the Descriptive Data Mining tasks is to summarize or turn given data into relevant information. The Descriptive Data-Mining Tasks can also be further divided into four types that are as follows:

             * Clustering Analysis
             * Summarization Analysis
             * Association Rules Analysis
             * Sequence Discovery Analysis
