# Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis is the process of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time. In time series analysis, data points are recorded at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points randomly. Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. Time series analysis typically requires large number of data points to ensure consistency and reliability.
