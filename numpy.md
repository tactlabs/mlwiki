# NumPy
It stands for ‘Numeric Python’. It is a cross-platform module and contains tools to iterate with C and C++. NumPy is a library that helps us handle large and multidimensional arrays and matrices. It provides a large collection of powerful methods to do multiple operations.

The following are the reasons for giving preference to the numpy array over lists:
* Numpy arrays occupy lesser memory
* They are faster
* They are also comparatively convenient to use, especially when we deal with multiple dimensions
