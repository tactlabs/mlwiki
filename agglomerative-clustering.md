# Agglomerative Clustering

Agglomerative Clustering is one of the strategies used in hierarchical clustering analysis. It starts with each data point considered as individual clusters called leafs. Then two clusters with the shortest distance will merge creating a node. The newly formed clusters will then merge with another cluster which has the shortest distance between them. This process is repeated till all the data points are assigned to one cluster called root.

The visual representation of this process is called a dendrogram. It is used to decide the number of clusters the data must be divided into.
