# Lemmatization

Lemmatization is another technique which is used to reduce words to a normalized form. In lemmatization, the transformation uses a dictionary to map different variants of a word back to its root format. So, with this approach, we are able to reduce non trivial inflections such as “is”, “was”, “were” back to the root “be”.
