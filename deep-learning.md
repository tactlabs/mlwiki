# Deep learning

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that deals with large amount of data with algorithms inspired by structure and function of a human brain. It consist of layers each with computational nodes called neurons. Every neuron connects with all the neuron of the underlying layers. Generally, a deep learning model has an input, an output and one or more hidden layers.
