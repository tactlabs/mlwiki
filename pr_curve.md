# PR Curve

A PR curve is a graph with Precision values on the y-axis and Recall values on the x-axis. In other words, the PR curve contains TP/(TP+FN) on the y-axis and TP/(TP+FP) on the x-axis.

It is desired that the algorithm should have both high precision, and high recall. However, most machine learning algorithms often involve a trade-off between the two.
