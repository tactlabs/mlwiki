###  Why you should learn SQL?
```
 𝟕 𝐔𝐒𝐄-𝐂𝐀𝐒𝐄𝐒 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐐𝐋 𝐨𝐫 𝐖𝐇𝐘 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧 𝐒𝐐𝐋?!

📌 (𝟏.) 𝐀 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐓𝐨𝐨𝐥 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬
👉 Data analysis involves processing and interpretation of data to deduce valuable information from it which can help in answering a question or solving a problem. SQL helps in the skill set for Data Analyst roles as it involves working with a humongous amount of data and performing manipulation on it. 

📌 (𝟐.) 𝐀𝐥𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐒𝐐𝐋 𝐨𝐫 𝐚 𝐅𝐥𝐚𝐯𝐨𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐈𝐭
👉Technology keeps on updating. With this, one has to be always updated with the latest technologies to survive in the tech industry. In the phase of learning new technology, SQL comes as a friend because most of the data-oriented technologies use SQL interface.

📌 (𝟑.) 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐩𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐢𝐧 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐇𝐮𝐠𝐞 𝐀𝐦𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚
👉 It’s data! This valuable data needs to be stored and managed efficiently. More books are getting replaced by ebooks, data entry registers are getting replaced by excel sheets. This leads to more data, more data leads to the need for the management of data.

📌 (𝟒.) 𝐀 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐮𝐚𝐠𝐞 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐲 𝐋𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐨 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤𝐬
👉 Usually, programming languages are assumed to be used for programming purposes only, but SQL breaks this stereotype as it can be used by people in the marketing or sales team to look through their data by executing a few queries on the dataset such as to see the trend of their sales or the marketing campaigns.

📌 (𝟓.) 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐫𝐲 𝐨𝐧 𝐚 𝐂𝐚𝐤𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐌𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠
👉 As we know, SQL works with data so when large data sets come into the picture, SQL helps in mining the useful data from a pool of datasets. SQL Server provides a data mining platform to perform operations such as Classification, Clustering, and Forecasting so that data can be classified, and figures can be estimated.

📌 (𝟔.) 𝐇𝐞𝐥𝐩𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐢𝐧 𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐮𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐬 𝐚 𝐂𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐫
👉 Data Science is a promising career choice, and it takes a data scientist to explore the data by swimming into its pool in search of patterns and discoveries. Big data platforms use SQL as their primary API to manage the relational databases.

📌(𝟕.) 𝐈𝐧-𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥
👉 Be it a developer, a product manager, or a business analyst, SQL helps in upskilling the career. According to the job portals, SQL is the most in-demand skill as it is robust and easy to learn programming language. Many top technical, as well as top financial giants, ask for SQL as it goes hand in hand with technologies.
