# Positive Skewness

If the given distribution is shifted to the left and with its tail on the right side, it is a positively skewed distribution. It is also called the right-skewed distribution. A tail is referred to as the tapering of the curve differently from the data points on the other side.

As the name suggests, a positively skewed distribution assumes a skewness value of more than zero. Since the skewness of the given distribution is on the right, the mean value is greater than the median and moves towards the right, and the mode occurs at the highest frequency of the distribution.
