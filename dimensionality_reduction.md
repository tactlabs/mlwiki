# Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset. More input features often make a predictive modeling task more challenging to model, more generally referred to as the curse of dimensionality.


PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique (algorithm) that transforms a set of correlated variables (p) into a smaller k (k < p) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components while retaining as much of the variation in the original dataset as possible.
