# Alternative Hypothesis

An alternative hypothesis is the inverse of a null hypothesis. An alternative hypothesis and a null hypothesis are mutually exclusive, which means that only one of the two hypotheses can be true. This hypothesis is denoted by either Ha or by H1.

It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to H0 and what we conclude when we reject H0.
