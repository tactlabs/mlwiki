# Softmax Function

The softmax function is a function that turns a vector of N real values into a vector of N real values that sums up to 1. The input values can be positive, negative, zero, or greater than one, but the softmax always transforms them into values between 0 and 1. This is done so that they can be interpreted as probabilities.

If one of the inputs is small or negative, the softmax turns it into a small value, and if an input is large, then it turns it into a large value, but it will always remain between 0 and 1.
