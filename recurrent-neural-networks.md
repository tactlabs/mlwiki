# Recurrent Neural Networks

A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data.These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and image captioning. RNN have a “memory” which remembers all information about what has been calculated. It uses the same parameters for each input as it performs the same task on all the inputs or hidden layers to produce the output. This reduces the complexity of parameters, unlike other neural networks.
