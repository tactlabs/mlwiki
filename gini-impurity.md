# Gini Impurity

Gini Impurity is a measurement used to build Decision Trees to determine how the features of a dataset should split nodes to form the tree. The Gini Impurity of a dataset is a number between 0 and 0.5, which indicates the likelihood of new and random data being misclassified if it were given a random class label according to the class distribution in the dataset.
