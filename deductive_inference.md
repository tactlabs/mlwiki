# Deductive Inferrence 

Inferences are made when a person (or machine) goes beyond available evidence to form a conclusion (Johnson-Laird, 1993). With a deductive inference, this conclusion always follows the stated premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion is valid.

Deductive learning is a subclass of machine learning that studies algorithms for learning provably correct knowledge. Typically such methods are used to speedup problem solvers by adding knowledge to them that is deductively entailed by existing knowledge, but that may result in faster solutions

There are three major types of deductive reasoning we can use to test deductions: 
* Syllogism
* Modus ponens
* Modus tollens.
