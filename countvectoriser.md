# CountVectoriser 

CountVectorizer is a great tool provided by the scikit-learn library in Python. It is used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency (count) of each word that occurs in the entire text

Count vectorizer creates a matrix with documents and token counts (bag of terms/tokens) therefore it is also known as document term matrix (dtm).

Well, here is an example: 

 “The weather was wonderful today and I went outside to enjoy the beautiful and sunny weather.” You can tell from the output below that the words “the”, “weather”, “and “and” appeared twice while other words appeared once. That is what Count Vectorization accomplishes.
