# Boosting

Boosting is an ensemble learning method used covert weak learners to strong learners. The main principle behind boosting is to train learners sequentially with each learner trying to correct it's predecessor. It is used to reduce the bias and variance in a model.

Types of boosting:

- AdaBoost - Adaptive Boosting
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost - Xtreme Gradient Boosting
