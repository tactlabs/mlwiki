# Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design and train better features.


The feature engineering process is:
* Brainstorming or testing features.
* Deciding what features to create.
* Creating features.
* Testing the impact of the identified features on the task.
* Improving your features if needed.
* Repeat.
