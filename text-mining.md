# Text Mining

Text mining, also known as text data mining, is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights. 

Text Mining is the practice of analyzing vast collections of textual materials to capture key concepts, trends and hidden relationships. 

Text mining uses natural language processing (NLP), allowing machines to understand the human language and process it automatically. 

When text mining and machine learning are combined, automated text analysis becomes possible. 

The process of text mining comprises several activities that enable you to deduce information from unstructured text data.
