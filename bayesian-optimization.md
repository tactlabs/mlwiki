# Bayesian Optimization

Bayesian Optimization is an derivative-free optimization algorithm used to optimize computationally expensive black box functions. It is commonly used in machine learning models to find the hyperparameters.

Usually the minimum or maximum value of a function can be found by equating the derivative of the function to zero. The roots obtained by solving this equation will yield the optimal value of the parameter and the optimal value of the function. By this is not possible for black box function whose algebraic form is unknown.

Thus Bayesian optimization is used to find the optimal value in small number of steps by using a surrogate model which stimulates the output of the costly black box function.
