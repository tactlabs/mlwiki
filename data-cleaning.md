# Data cleaning :

Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. 

When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled.


Data cleaning is the process of ensuring data is correct, consistent and usable. 

You can clean data by identifying errors or corruptions, correcting or deleting them, or manually processing data as needed to prevent the same errors from occurring.


Data cleansing ensures you only have the most recent files and important documents, so when you need to, you can find them with ease. 

It also helps ensure that you do not have significant amounts of personal information on your computer, which can be a security risk.
