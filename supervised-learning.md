# Supervised learning

In supervised learning, we have a basic idea beforehand as to what the result is going to be. The input data is labeled and the main task of the model is to either map the output with the input labels or when the input label is mapped as a continuous output.
The datasets used are designed to supervise these algorithms into performing their tasks.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems classification and regression.
