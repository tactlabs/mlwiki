# Self-Organising Maps (SOMs)

A self-organising map is an unsupervised neural network trained using unsupervised learning techniques to produce a low dimensional, a discretised representation based on the input space of the training samples, known as a map. It is a method to reduce data dimensions. They apply competitive learning techniques to preserve all the topological properties within the input space.
